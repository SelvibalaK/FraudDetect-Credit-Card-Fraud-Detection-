# FraudDetect üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüí≥

Welcome to the FraudDetect repository!

## About
FraudDetect is a machine learning project developed solely by me during my internship at Codeway Solutions. This project focuses on detecting credit card fraud using logistic regression. The model is trained on labeled data from fraudTrain.csv and tested on fraudTest.csv. The fraudTrain.csv dataset contains approximately 334 MB of transaction data, while fraudTest.csv contains about 143 MB. Due to its large size, this dataset cannot be uploaded directly to GitHub. To obtain the dataset or inquire about the data collection process, please raise an issue or contact me through the repository's contact information.

## Project Highlights:
- **Predictive Model:** Logistic Regression model trained on credit card transaction data to detect fraud.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Includes standard scaling and feature selection to prepare the data for modeling.
- **Model Evaluation:** Utilizes metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report to evaluate model performance.
- **Internship Experience:** Developed solely by me during my internship at Codeway Solutions, providing hands-on experience in machine learning and data analysis.

## Usage:
Explore the FraudDetect repository to access code, documentation, and datasets related to credit card fraud detection. The project includes detailed instructions on how to use the model and replicate the results.

## Directory Structure:
- **data:**  Contains the datasets used for training and testing the model.
- **scripts:** Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **models:** Serialized model files for deployment.
- **spyder_projects:** Spyder IDE project files and analysis scripts.
